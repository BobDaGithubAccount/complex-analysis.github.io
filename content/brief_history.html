    <h2>Geometric interpretation of <br>quadratic and cubic equations</h2>

    <div class="w3-responsive">
      <p>Consider a quadratic equation
        \begin{eqnarray}\label{quad001}
        x^2 = mx + n.
        \end{eqnarray}
        From elementary school we have learned how to find its solutions,
        that is, all the values of $x$ that satisfy equation
        (\ref{quad001}). To do so we just need to use the widely known
        <em>quadratic formula</em>
        \begin{eqnarray}\label{quad002}
        x = \frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
        \end{eqnarray}
        of the <em>general quadratic equation </em>
        \begin{eqnarray}\label{quad003}
        ax^2+ bx+c = 0 .
        \end{eqnarray}
        By rewritting equation (\ref{quad001}) as $x^2-mx-n = 0$, we can
        use (\ref{quad002}) to obtain
        \begin{eqnarray}\label{quad004}
        x = \frac{ m \pm \sqrt{m^2 + 4n } }{2} = \frac{m}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{m^2}{4} + n}
        \end{eqnarray}
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      If we plot equation (\ref{quad001}) we can observe geometrically that
      it represents the intersection of the parabola $y=x^2$ with the line $y = mx+n$.
      This can be appreciated in the following applet. Drag the sliders below and
      observe what happens with the intersection points $x_0$ and $x_1$.
    </p>

        Rotate your device to landscape. Or resize your window so it's more wide than tall.</p>
    </div>
    <br>

    <p>
      As you already noticed, we have three cases:
      <ol>
        <li>There are two points of intersection, i. e. two solutions.</li>
        <li>There is only one intersection point, i. e. one solution.</li>
        <li>There are no intersection points, i. e. there are no solutions.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
      Surprisingly this has been known since ancient times,
      even without the use of mathematical symbols or computers.
     We know from clay tablets dated from around 2000 BCE that the Babylonian 
civilization possessed the quadratic formula, enabling them (in verbal form) to solve quadratic equations.
      Because the concept of negative numbers had to wait until the sixteenth century
      to appear, the Babylonians did not consider negative
      solutions
      <span style="white-space: nowrap;">[<a href="#merzbach-boyer" alt="Merzbach-Boyer" title="Merzbach-Boyer">9</a>,
        pp. 29-30]</span>.
      We can also find implicitly equations
      in the geometry developed by the
      ancient Greeks, as we would expect when circles, parabolas, and the like
      are being investigated, but we do not demand that every geometric problem have a solution
      [<a href="#merzbach-boyer" alt="Merzbach-Boyer" title="Merzbach-Boyer">9</a>, Ch. 4].
      If we ask whether a particular circle and a line intersect, then the answer
      can be ‘yes’ or ‘no’. And when the answer is ‘yes’, the quadratic equation
      for the intersection has a solution; if ‘no’, it has no solution.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now let's go back to the quadratic equation $x^2= mx+ n$.
      Consider the values $m=0$ and $n=-1$.
      If we use formula (\ref{quad004}), we obtain that
      $$x = \pm\sqrt{-1}.$$
      What is going on here?
      Most of you have learned from calculus, or elementary school, that we cannot
      take the square root of a negative number.
      Then, how do interpret this value? Geometrically speaking,
      we can relate the solution $x = \pm\sqrt{-1}$ to the fact that
      the parabola $y = x^2$ and the line $y=-1$ do
      not intersect each other, see Figure 1. In other words, there is no solution.
      In general, if $\dfrac{m^2}{4} + n \lt 0$,
      then equation $x^2= mx+ n$ has no solutions.
    </p>

        style="width:70%;">
      <figcaption>
        <b>Figure 1:</b> $x^2=-1$.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>


    <p>
      It is argued that this led to the invetion of a new number denoted by $i$,
      which is equal to $\sqrt{-1}$, and it was given the name "imaginary".
      If we use $i$ as a number such that $i^2 = -1$,
      then this value is the solution of the equation $x^2=-1$.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is also a common practice to point out in courses of mathematics that
      <em>complex numbers</em>, denoted as $a + b\sqrt{-1}$, are needed to solve certain
      quadratic equations, such as $x^2+1=0$.
      However, complex numbers emerged, in fact, from the need to solve cubic equations.
      Furthermore, when quadratic and cubic equations first appeared,
      at that time, there was no need to have solutions for all equations.
    </p>

    <p>
      So where did complex numbers really come into importance? To answer this let's
      consider the cubic equation
      \begin{eqnarray}\label{cubic001}
      x^3 = p x + q.
      \end{eqnarray}
      Geometrycally, this equation represents the intersection of the cubic
      $y = x^3$ with the line $y = px + q$,
      as shown in the following applet. Drag sliders below and observe what happens.
    </p>

    <div class="w3-center w3-hide-small">
      <div style="display:block;width:798;height:516;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;" id="ggb-element-02"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-hide-large w3-hide-medium w3-khaki w3-round w3-padding w3-panel">

        Rotate your device to landscape. Or resize your window so it's more wide than tall.</p>
    </div>
    <br>

    <p>
      As you can observe no matter what line is defined by the parameters $p$ and $q$,
      it will always intersect the cubic somewhere, even when the line
      $px+q$ is perpendicular to the $x$-axis and far from the origin (i. e. when
      $p$ and $q$ are both very large positive/negative numbers).
      This is because the cubic
      goes all the way from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$.
      Thus, there is no line you can draw that won't intersect this cubic.
      This example is very different from the quadratic case which was a parabola $x^2$
      and you could define a line $mx + n$ such that it won't intersect the parabola.
    </p>

    <h2>Solution to cubic equations</h2>

    <div class="w3-responsive">
      <p>
        It is well known that the solution of the cubic $x^3 = px + q$
        was developed in the Renaissance (15th and 16th centuries) by Italian
        mathematicians. Scipione del Ferro (1465-1526) and Niccolò Tartaglia (1500-1557),
        followed by Girolamo Cardano (1501-1576), showed that $x^3 = px + q$
        has a solution given by
        \begin{eqnarray}\label{cubic002}
         x = \sqrt[3]{\frac{q}{2} + \sqrt{\frac{q^2}{4} - \frac{p^3}{27}}} -
        \sqrt[3]{- \frac{q}{2} + \sqrt{\frac{q^2}{4} - \frac{p^3}{27}}} 
        \end{eqnarray}
	  This is known as Cardano's formula and here we are using modern notation.

    <p>
      To see how this works consider the
      equation $x^3 = -6 x+ 20$.
      In this case $p=-6$ and $q=20$. If we plug these numbers into
      (\ref{cubic002}), we obtain the solution
      $$x = \displaystyle \sqrt[3]{10 + \sqrt{108}} -
      \sqrt[3]{- 10 + \sqrt{108}}$$
      Simplifying we obtain $x=2$, a solution of the given equation since
      $$8=(2)^3 = -6(2)+ 20 = -12+20=8.$$
      Thus, this formula seems to work very well, at least for this case.

    <h2>The genesis of imaginary numbers</h2>

    <p>
      A few years later after the discovery of Cardano's formula,
      the Italian engineer-architect Rafael Bombelli (1526-1572)
      recognized that there was something strange and paradoxcal about this formula.
      He considered the equation
      \begin{eqnarray}\label{cubic003}
      x^3= 15 x+ 4
      \end{eqnarray}
      and, with perhaps just a little
      pondering, you can see that $x = 4$ is a solution. This can also
      be seen in Figure 2. In fact there are three solutions, but
      Bombelli did not consider negative values, so we won't either.
    </p>

    <figure class="w3-center">
      <img class="w3-image w3-mobile" src="../images/chp01/cubic-line.svg" alt="x^3=15x+4" title="x^3=15x+4"
        style="width:60%;">
      <figcaption>
        <b>Figure 4:</b> $x^3=15x+4$.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <div class="w3-responsive">
      <p>
        Then Bombelli used Cardano's formula to solve $x^3= 15 x+ 4$.
        Thus, considering $p = 15$ and $q=4$,
        he obtained
        \begin{eqnarray}\label{cubic004}
        x = \displaystyle \sqrt[3]{2 + \sqrt{-121}} + \sqrt[3]{2 - \sqrt{-121}}.
        \end{eqnarray}
        Here he encountered a very unusual value. If Cardano's formula
        is correct, this number must be equal to 4.
        Yet this must be nonsense and the value cannot be real,
        because inside the cube root we are taking
        the square root of a negative number, an absolute impossibility
        at that time (and also nowadays).
	  Cardano also encountered this difficulty but he did not face it up.
	    He did once mention imaginary numbers, but in connection 
	      with a quadratic equation and accompanied by the comment that 
	      these numbers were "as subtle as ther are useless" [<a href="#cardano" alt="Cardano" title="Cardano">3</a>, Ch. 37, Rule II]
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      However, Bombelli overcome this difficulty
      by seeing that the weird expression (\ref{cubic004})
      that Cardano's formula gives for $x$ is actually real,
      but expressed in a very unfamiliar manner. This
      insight did not come easily. As Bombelli wrote in his book <em>L'Algebra</em>:
      <div class="w3-padding">
        <p>
          It was a wild thought in the judgement of many; and I
          too for a long time was of the same
          opinion. The whole matter seemed to rest on sophistry rather than on truth.
          Yet I sought so long, until I actually proved this to be the case. [<a href="#burton"  alt="Burton" title="Burton">2</a>, p. 325]

        </p>
      </div>

      <figure class="w3-center">
        <img class="w3-image w3-mobile" src="../images/chp01/algebra-bombelli.gif" alt="x^2=-1" title="x^2=-1"
          style="width:30%;">
        <figcaption>

          the Bologna edition of 1579.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </p>

    <div class="w3-responsive">
      <p>
        Bombelli's great insight was simply to treat $\sqrt{-1}$ as a number and to operate with
        it following some specific arithmetic rules (the same kind of rules that we use nowdays).
        Thus he discovered that
        $$\sqrt[3]{2+ \sqrt{-121}} = 2 + \sqrt{-1} \quad \text{and} \quad \sqrt[3]{2- \sqrt{-121}} = 2 - \sqrt{-1} .$$
        By substituing these values in (\ref{cubic004}) Bombelli obtained
        $$x = 2 + \sqrt{-1} + 2 - \sqrt{-1}.$$
        Then he showed that the squared roots of negative numbers cancel each other
        [<a href="#bombelli" alt="Bombelli" title="Bombelli">1</a>, p. 169;
        <a href="#gonzalez-velasco" alt="Gonzalez-velasco" title="Gonzalez-Velasco">7</a>, p. 164]. That is
        $$x = 2 + \cancel{\sqrt{-1}} + 2 - \cancel{\sqrt{-1}}.$$
        And concluded that the $x = 4$ is actually the solution of $x^3=15x+4$
        obtained from Cardano's formula [<a href="#bombelli" alt="Bombelli" title="Bombelli">1</a>, p. 294].
        This trick works in only a few cases, however, it helped to
        understand imaginary numbers and to take their cube roots or 
        manipulate them when they appear aside real numbers.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Of course, neither Cardano nor Bombelli had at his disposal the power of today's algebraic notation,
      (and computers) and his computations were limited to numbers in "real domain".
      In fact, most of italian mathematicians at that time tended to think of cubes or squares
      as geometric objects rather than algebraic quantities. However, he is credited for
      proving the reality of the roots of the cubic $x^3=15x+4$,
      since he demonstrated the extraordinary fact that real numbers could be
      engendered by imaginary numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether nonsense or not, Cardano's formula forced mathematicians
      to confront square roots of negative numbers.

      This historical incident is another example that negates the widespread
      view that mathematics is "made up" by mathematicians. As is often the case, it is
      the mathematics itself that speaks to us.
      From this time on, imaginary numbers lost some of their mystical
      character, although their full acceptance as <em>bona fide</em>
      numbers came only in the 1800s.

    <h2>The maturing of complex numbers</h2>

    <p>
      Many mathematicians after Cardano and Bombelli made important contributions to
      imaginary (or complex) numbers. For example René Descartes (1596-1650)
      coined the term "imaginary" in his book in <em>La Géométrie</em> of 1637 as follows:

    </p>

    <div class="w3-padding">
      <p>Neither the true nor the false [negative] roots are always real; but sometimes
        only imaginary. [<a href="#descartes" alt="Descartes" title="Descartes">4</a>, p. 380]
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      John Wallis (1616-1703) showed how to represent geometrically complex
      roots of a quadratic equation with real coefficients 
      [<a href="#kline" alt="Kline" title="Kline">8</a>, p. 594].
      Carpar Wessel (1745-1818) and
      <span style="white-space: nowrap;">Jean-Robert</span>
      Argan (1768-1822)
      provided geometric representations of complex numbers as vectors
      [<a href="#gonzalez-velasco" alt="Gonzalez-Velasco" title="Gonzalez-Velasco">7</a>, pp. 185-190].
    </p>

    <p>
      Leonard Euler (1707-1783) standirezed the notation "$i=\sqrt{-1}$"
      [<a href=#euleri>6</a>, p. 184] and used imaginary numbers to solve
      quadratic and cubic equations, in spite of the fact that he
      was still suspicious of these numbers.
      In his <em>Algebra</em>, for example, he mentioned:
    </p>

    <div class="w3-padding">
      <p>[...] since all numbers which it is possible to conceive
        are either greater or less than 0, or aere 0 itself, it is
        evident that we cannot rank the square root of a negative
        number amongst possible numbers, and we must therefore
        say that it is an impossible quantity. In this manner we are
        led to the idea of numbers, which from their nature are impossible;
        and therefore they are usually called imaginary
        quantities, because they exist merely in the imagination.
        [<a href="#euler-algebra" alt="Euler-Algebra"
          title="Euler-Algebra">5</a>, p. 43]
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Lest anyone takes this as a condemnation, he continued:
    </p>

    <div class="w3-padding">
      <p>notwithstanding this, these numbers present
        themselves to the mind; they exists in our
        imagination, and we still have a sufficient idea of
        them; [...] nothing prevent us from making use of these
        imaginary numbers, and employing them in calculation.
        <span style="white-space: nowrap;">[<a href="#euler-algebra" alt="Euler" title="Euler">5</a>, p.
          43]</span>
        
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Later Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) introduced the term "complex number"
      refering to numbers of the form $a+ b \, i $
      [<a href="#gonzalez-velasco" alt="Gonzalez-Velasco" title="Gonzalez-Velasco">7</a>, p. 191].
      He also gave four proofs of the <em>fundamental theorem of algebra</em> over the course of
      his long career. This theorem telss us that 
      any $n$th-degree polynomial has $n$ roots, some or all of which
      may be imaginary. The first proof that Gauss gave was in his doctoral 
      dissertation of 1799. The last (and perhaps the most elegant)
      allows the use of complex numbers not only for the variable but
      for the coefficients as well. Since this necessarily depended on the recognition
      of complex numbers, Gauss helped to solidify the position of these
      numbers [<a href="#kline" alt="Kline" title="Kline">8</a>, p. 595].
    </p>

  
      <p>
        The first rigorous definition of complex numbers was given until the ninteenth
        century by William Rowan Hamilton (1805-1865). In 1833 he proposed to the Irish Academy
        that a complex number can be considered as a <em>couple</em> $(a, b)$,
        with $a,b$ real numbers
        <span style="white-space: nowrap;">[<a href="#gonzalez-velasco" alt="Gonzalez-Velasco"
            title="Gonzalez-Velasco">7</a>, pp. 192-193].</span>
        Then he defined addition and multiplication
        of <em>couples</em> as follows:
        $$(a, b)+(c, d) =(a + c, b + d)$$
        and
        $$(a, b)(c, d) = (ac − bd, bc + ad).$$
        This is in fact an algebraic definition of complex numbers.

      Among the many mathematicians and scientists who contributed,
      there are three who stand out as having influenced decisively the course of
      development of complex analysis 
      [<a href="#kline" alt="Kline" title="Kline">8</a>, Vol.2, Ch. 27]. 
      The first is Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789-1857), who
      developed the theory of the complex integral calculus.
      By using imaginary numbers Cauchy was able to
      evaluate "real integrals" that heretofore could not be evaluated,
      obtaining stuning results such as
      $$\int_0^{\infty} \frac{\sin x}{x}\,dx=\frac{\pi}{2}$$
      and
      $$\int_0^{\pi}\log \sin x\,dx =\pi \log 2.$$</p>

      The other two are Karl Weierstrass
      (1815-1897) and Bernhard Riemann (1826-1866), who appeared on the
      mathematical scene about the middle of the nineteenth century. Weierstrass
      developed the theory from a starting point of convergent power series, and
      this approach led towards more formal algebraic developments. Riemann
      contributed a more geometric point of view. His ideas had a tremendous
      impact not only on complex analysis but upon mathematics as a whole,
      though his views took hold only gradually.
    </p>




    <p>
      To summarize, the solution of the cubic equation, the fundamental
      theorem of algebra, and the evaluation of real integrals
      proved how valuable it was to consider imaginary numbers $a + bi$, 
      even though they were not (at least not yet) on firm ground. 
      Do they really exist or are they simply
      phantoms of our "imagination", and thus truly "imaginary"?

      The foregoing descriptions of complex numbers are not the end of the story.
      Various developments in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries enabled us
      to gain a deeper insight into the role of complex numbers not only in mathematics,
      but also in engineering and physics.
      The history of complex numbers is fascinating and I highly encourage
      the reader to consult the primary sources cited here which
      could serve as a starting point to delve into the historical
      details that allowed the emergence and development of complex numbers.
